## Solutions for Exploratory Data Analysis - Course Project

1. Plots can be found in the [myplots](https://github.com/fleclee/ExData_Plotting1/tree/master/myplots) directory of this repository.  All plots are PNG files per specification.

2. The R code to create each of the plots can be found in the root directory of this repository.

3. In addition to code generating each plot, there is a script to generate the usable data set call [getting_data.R](https://github.com/fleclee/ExData_Plotting1/blob/master/getting_data.R).  This script downloads and unzips the data so the plots can be reproduced at anytime. (In order to save space, the original data file have been removed.)
